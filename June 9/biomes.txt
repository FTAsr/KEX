A biome is a large ecosystem that has its own kinds of plants, animals and soil. Biomes also have their own pattern of temperature and rainfall. The largest biome in the world is the taiga. The taiga is a cool forest biome. Fir and spruce trees grow almost everywhere in the taiga. These trees provide most of the world's lumber. The taiga also contains lakes and ponds that formed thousands of years ago. Taiga winters are long and cold. Along and near earth's equator are tropical rainforests. These biomes are hot and humid with plenty of rainfall. Most forests have three parts. The canopy spreads over the forest like a huge umbrella. There, the top leaves of the tallest trees receive the most light. Beneath the canopy is the understory. Here, the dense layer of leaves makes it very damp. The lower part of a forest is its floor. It is so dark on the forest floor that few kinds of plants can grow.
