The earth is made of layers. The crust is the thinnest, outer layer. The mantle is the layer that lies beneath the crust. Earths surface is broken into several huge plates of rock. Plates are made of the crust and the upper part of the earths mantle. The crust and lower mantle are solid, but the upper mantle can flow. When the mantle flows, earths plates move. Earths plates move about as slowly as your fingernails grow. The moving plates get pushed and pulled, changing the crust. You cannot see or feel most of these changes. As plates get pushed and pulled, cracks called faults form in the crust. A fault is a crack in the crust along which movement takes place. Rocks on either side of a fault can slide up while others slip down. If the lifting is spread over a wide area, a plateau may form. A plateau is a high landform. Some plates meet at the edge of continents. If the land scrunches up between them, a fold forms. A fold is a bend in the rock layers. If the land keeps scrunching, a fold becomes a mountain. A mountain is a tall landform.
