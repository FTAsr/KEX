A wild animal faces constant danger or threats in its habitat. Here are some ways animals protect themselves Camouflage Some animals have body colors or patterns that help them look like their environment. The colors and patterns are called camouflage. Camouflaged animals are difficult for predators to see. Their camouflage may help them survive in their environment. One example is the snowshoe rabbit. During the summer months, snowshoe rabbits are brown. During the winter months a snowshoe rabbits fur turns white, like the snow. Mimicry Mimicry is when one animal looks like another animal. The trick is that the animal mimics another animal that is dangerous or bad tasting. A predator will avoid both animals because it thinks both might be dangerous or bad tasting. For example, the Scarlet King snake is not poisonous. But, predators avoid it because it looks like the poisonous Coral snake. Migration In environments where winters are cold and harsh many animals simply leave. Moving with the seasons is called migration. Some geese migrate thousands of miles to find food and to live in a warmer climate.Hibernation Some animals hibernate to avoid a cold winter climate. When animals hibernate their body activities slow down. They go into a long, deep sleep. They live off of their own fat so they do not need to find food. This helps them to survive a season when food is not available. Bats and bears are animals that hibernate during winter.
