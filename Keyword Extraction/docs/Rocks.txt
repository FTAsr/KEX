Limestone Limestone is a rock that is often formed from the shells, skeletons, and other remains of old sea life. Water can dissolve or break down limestone. This is why caves and caverns form in areas where there is a lot of limestone. The limestone dissolves away to make the opening for the cave. Limestone is often whitish gray and feels chalky. Limestone is a sedimentary rock, meaning that it is made from other materials. Sandstone Sandstone is a very common rock that is formed when sand grains are cemented together. The color of the sandstone depends on the material that cements it together. When sandstone is red, it is because the cementing material has iron in it. Iron is a type of mineral that is also a metal. Sandstone feels like sandpaper. Sandstone is also a sedimentary rock. Quartzite Quartzite is formed when sand gets a lot of heat and pressure. The heat and pressure causes the rock to become harder, which makes it more difficult to break down. Quartzite is a metamorphic rock, meaning that it is made from a change that occurs from heat and pressure.
