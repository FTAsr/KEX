The biggest difference between animals is that some have backbones and some do not. Animals with backbones are called vertebrates. There are five groups of vertebrate animals. Frogs, toads, and salamanders are amphibians. They usually have smooth, moist skin. When they are young they breathe with gills and live in water. When they are adults, they breathe with lungs and can go on land. They lay jellylike eggs. Chickens, hawks, and robins are birds. They have wings and feathers. They use lungs to breathe. They lay hard-shelled eggs. Goldfish, trout, and sharks are fish. They are usually covered with scales. They breathe through gills. Some lay eggs, and some have live babies. Humans, whales, dogs, and monkeys are mammals. They have hair or fur during all or part of their life. They breathe with lungs. Most have live babies that are fed milk from their mothers. Snakes, turtles, and alligators are reptiles. They are covered with scales or plates. They use lungs to breathe. They lay rubbery eggs. Animals without backbones are called invertebrates. Some invertebrates, like worms and slugs, have soft bodies. Crabs, spiders, and insects are also invertebrates. They have skeletons on the outside of their bodies, called exoskeletons.
