A river is a moving body of freshwater. It begins at a source, which is the original point from which the river flows. A river ends at a mouth, which is where the river flows into another body of water, such as a lake or ocean. Rivers always flow downhill. As the land gets flatter, the river flows slower. There are over 250000 rivers in the United States. The longest river in the United States is the Missouri River, but the biggest river is the Mississippi River. The Mississippi river is the biggest because it has the largest amount of water and it is deeper. Water from rivers carry bits of sand and soil, also known as grit, that are eventually dropped when the river meets another body of water like a lake or another river. These bits of sand and soil form a delta. A  delta is a landform that is formed at the mouth of a river. A delta is often shaped like a triangle.
