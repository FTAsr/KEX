Crust The continents and ocean floor make up Earths outer layer. This is called the crust. The crust is Earths thinnest and coolest layer. It is a layer of solid rock that makes up the surface of the earth.Mantle The layer below the crust is the mantle. The mantle is made of two parts, the upper portion and the lower portion. The upper portion is solid rock.  The lower portion is soft and semi-molten. Semi-molten means that it is part liquid, and is able to flow slowly. It is a lot like putty. The mantle is the thickest layer of the earth. Core The core is the center of the Earth. The core is the deepest and hottest layer of the Earth. The core can be as hot as 13,000 degrees Fahrenheit!  It has two different parts, an outer core and an inner core. The outer core is melted rock made of liquid iron and liquid nickel. The inner core is solid rock made of solid iron and solid nickel.
