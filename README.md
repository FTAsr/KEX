<b> Unsupervised Keyword Extraction </b>

The repository contains two folders: KEX1 and KEX3

<b>KEX1</b> has the entire code and can be used for running directly for quick results.

<b>KEX3</b> has the KEX3 Class file(KEX3.py) which has a Wrapper Class (Extractor) that helps in easy reuseablity of our methods.

<b>KEX3</b> also contains an evaluation file that takes in the ground truth data to compare and output results
with different models from our work.
