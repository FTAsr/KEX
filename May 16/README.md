In this folder, we have two different methods.

The first method uses Clustering </b>along with PCA. 
The program is titled <b>kmeans_pca_final.py</b> 
This takes three files, the input document, a stopword list, 
and ground truth file. It currently takes all these in the program,
and <b> not </b> as arguments.
<br>

The second method is closest word search.
The description of what this method means is given
in detail in the report. 
The program is titled <b>closest_word_search_final.py</b> 

<br>
The text files used for the previous methods can be used for
this.
