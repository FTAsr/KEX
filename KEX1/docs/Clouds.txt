A cloud is a collection of tiny water drops or ice crystals in the air. There are many different kinds of clouds. Rain falls from clouds, but not all clouds bring rain. Stratus clouds form low in the sky.  They are made of flat thin layers of clouds that can cover most of the sky.  Stratus clouds can be gray or white, and stratus clouds often bring rain or snow. Fog is a stratus cloud that formed near the ground, and like other clouds, fog is made of tiny drops of water. Cirrus clouds are some of the highest clouds in the sky. They are thin, wispy white clouds. Cirrus clouds are usually seen during fair weather. If you see these clouds in the sky, rain may fall in about a day or so. Cumulus clouds are white, puffy clouds with flat bottoms. They form at low heights in the sky. You can usually see them during fair weather, but if they become dark though they may bring thunderstorms.
